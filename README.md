# IK-AHC

This repository is used for demonstration of using Isolation Kernel to improve agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithms. It contains the implementation of IK_AHC using MATLAB and Python.

Written by Ye Zhu@Deakin University and Xin Han@University of Macau, Mar 2023, version 1.0.

## Demo
A comparison of AHC and IK-AHC on a two dimensional dataset is shown below with the Matlab code [(demo.m)](https://github.com/zhuye88/IK-AHC/tree/main/Matlab/demo/demo.m).
